## What is it?

**Shhh** is a tiny Flask app to write encrypted secrets and share them with people
using a secure link.  

You can see a demo of Shhh running [here](https://i.imgur.com/XcuhA0o.gif).  

Shhh is live at [shhh-encrypt.com](https://shhh-encrypt.com), but as you can't trust 
everyone with your data, **the goal of this app is for organizations or people to run 
it on their own personal / private server for more security**. You can find in this repo 
everything you need to host the app.  

## How does it work?

The sender has to set up an expiration date along with a passphrase to protect 
the secret he wants to share.  

A unique link is generated by Shhh that the sender can share with the receiver in an email, along with the 
temporary passphrase to reveal the secret.  

The secret will be permanently removed from the database whenever one of these things happen:   
* the expiration date has passed (max 7 days).  
* the receiver has decrypt the message using the passphrase.  

The secrets are encrypted in order to make the data anonymous, especially in the database.  
_Encryption method used: Fernet with password, random salt value and strong iteration count (100 000)._  

_Tip: For added security, avoid telling in Shhh what is the use of the secret you're 
sharing. Instead, explain this in your email, and copy paste the Shhh link with the passphrase
so the user can retrieve it._  

## What's the stack?

Core application  
* **[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)**, used as our Python backend web-framework.  
* **[Celery](http://www.celeryproject.org/)** runs scheduled tasks very minutes that checks for expired records to delete.  
* **[Redis](https://redis.io/)** that works as our Celery broker.  

Database  
* **[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)** used to store only: the unique links, the encrypted messages, the creation and expiration dates.  

Frontend  
* **JS**, only pure Javascript code.  
* **[Bulma](https://bulma.io/)**, the CSS framework.  

Monitoring  
* **[Flower](https://flower.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)**, used for Celery monitoring.  
* **[Adminer](https://www.adminer.org/)**, check MySQL records.  

Server  
* **[Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/)**, used for the app WSGI server.  
* **[Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/)**, used for the web server.  


## What are the dependencies?

You can find the list of the Python packages [here](https://github.com/smallwat3r/shhh/blob/master/requirements.txt), plus [here](https://github.com/smallwat3r/shhh/blob/master/gunicorn/requirements-gunicorn.txt) if you're using Gunicorn.  

## How to launch Shhh?

These methods are for development purpose only. If you want to use it in production
you probably want to use Gunicorn with Nginx, and use a more secure configuration.  

<details>
<summary>Launch it natively</summary>

#### MySQL

You will need a MySQL server running on localhost in the background.  
Create a MySQL database and run the following script to generate the
table `links` that will store our data.  

```sql
CREATE TABLE `links` (
`slug_link` text,
`encrypted_text` text,
`date_created` datetime DEFAULT NULL,
`date_expires` datetime DEFAULT NULL
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;
```

This MySQL query can also be executed against the MySQL server instance via
the `mysql/initialize.sql` file.  

#### Redis  

You will also need Redis running on localhost in the background has it will
work as our Celery broker. Open a new terminal window and launch it.    
```sh
redis-server
```

#### Flask and Celery   

In another terminal window, clone this repository and go inside it.
```sh 
git clone https://github.com/smallwat3r/shhh.git && cd shhh
```

We recommend that you create a virtual environment for this project, so you can
install the required dependencies.  

```sh
virtualenv -p python3 venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Stay in the virtual environment created.  

You then need to set up a few environment variables. These will be used to
configure Flask, as well as the app's connection to MySQL.  

```sh
export FLASK_APP=shhh
export FLASK_ENV=dev-local
export FLASK_DEBUG=1
export HOST_MYSQL=127.0.0.1
export USER_MYSQL=<your MySQL username>
export PASS_MYSQL=<your MySQL password>
export DB_MYSQL=<name of the MySQL database created>
```

We then need to launch our Celery worker.  

To launch our Celery worker, open a new terminal window, go to the
project and run  

```sh
source venv/bin/activate  # make sure we are connected to our virtual env.
celery -A shhh._celery.tasks worker --loglevel=INFO
```

Then we need to launch Celery beat that will be triggered by the worker to
delete the expired records from the database every minutes.  

To launch Celery beat, open a third terminal window, go to the
project and run  

```sh
source venv/bin/activate  # make sure we are connected to our virtual env.
celery -A shhh._celery.tasks beat --loglevel=INFO
```

Then go back to your first terminal where you first set-up your virtual env
and launch flask with

```sh
python -m flask run --host='0.0.0.0'
```

You can now access Shhh on http://localhost:5000/  

You should be able to see in your other terminal windows the logs from 
Redis, Celery and Celery beat trigerring and receiving tasks to check
and deleted the expired records.  
</details>

<details>
<summary>Launch it with docker-compose (recommended)</summary>

#### docker-compose  

You will need Docker, docker-compose and make installed on your machine.  

For development instances of Shhh, this repo contains 2 docker-compose
configurations. The configurations defines default settings for Shhh,
default settings for a containerized instance of MySQL server,
as default settings for Redis, Celery (worker + beat) and Nginx. To build and
run Shhh via docker-compose:  

```sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d         # run app with native Flask 
docker-compose -f docker-compose-nginx.yml up -d   # run app with Gunicorn <> Nginx 
```

or via Makefile:

```sh
make dc-start          # start app (with native Flask)
made dc-start-nginx    # start app (with Gunicorn <> Nginx)

                       # other commands
                       # --------------
make dc-stop           # stop app (with native Flask)
make dc-stop-nginx     # stop app (with Gunicorn <> Nginx)
make dc-reboot         # reboot app (with native Flask)
make dc-reboot-nginx   # reboot app (with Gunicorn <> Nginx)
make dc-cleanup        # clean (with native Flask)
make dc-cleanup-nginx  # clean (with Gunicorn <> Nginx)
```

Once the container image has finished building and starting, you can access:  

* Shhh at http://localhost:5000 (native Flask) or http://localhost (Gunicorn <> Nginx)  
* MySQL data records using Adminer via http://localhost:8080/  
* Celery monitoring using Flower via http://localhost:8888/  

_Note that Adminer and Flower are not running within Nginx._   

</details>

## Is there an API?  

Yes, the endpoints are `/api/c` (create) and `/api/r` (read).  

Notes: 
* Passphrases needs min. 5 chars, 1 number and 1 uppercase.  
* Max number of days to keep a secret alive is 7.  
* Max number of characters for the secret is 150.  

**Example with CURL**  

Create a secret  
```sh 
curl -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"secret": "This is secret.", "passphrase": "Passw123", "days": 3}' \
    https://shhh-encrypt.com/api/c

# outputs
{   
    "details": "Secret successfully created.",
    "expires_on": "2020-01-16 at 22:53 GMT",
    "link": "https://shhh-encrypt.com/r/BuMwIftk-T2GQIuewRB-",
    "slug": "BuMwIftk-T2GQIuewRB-",
    "status": "created"
}
```

Read a secret  
```sh
curl -X GET \
    https://shhh-encrypt/api/r?slug=BuMwIftk-T2GQIuewRB-&passphrase=Passw123

# outputs
{
    "msg": "This is secret.",
    "status": "success"
}
```
